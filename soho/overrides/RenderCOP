 *
 * This override file provides the mapping from the options on the
 * render command to parameters evaluated by SOHO.
 *
 *	$imagefile	- The filename to store the image
 *	$resolution	- The COP resolution
 *	$aspect		- Aspect ratio from the COP
 *
 * These overrides are applied to the CAMERA object given in the
 * initialization of SOHO.
 *
 * FILE STRUCTURE:
 *	Please see ViewportRender for details.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *	This file is used to provide overrides when the render is
 *	invoked by the render COP.
