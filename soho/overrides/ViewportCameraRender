 * COMMENTS:
 *
 * Like the ViewportRender file, this file gives SOHO a set of
 * overrides.  However, this file is used when the viewport is looking
 * through a camera (or light) object.
 *
 * The viewport provides several parameters which can be used to evaluate
 * values from the viewport settings.  These are:
 *
 *	$camera		- The full path to the camera
 *	$viewport_res	- The actual resolution of the viewport
 *	$viewport_name	- The path to the Houdini UI viewport
 *
 * These overrides are applied to the CAMERA object given in the
 * initialization of SOHO.
