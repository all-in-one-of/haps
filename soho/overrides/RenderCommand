 *
 * COMMENTS:
 * When the user runs the render command, it's possible that they
 * specify overrides for particular information on the command line.
 *
 * This override file provides the mapping from the options on the
 * render command to parameters evaluated by SOHO.
 *
 *	$over_file		- The -o option (output filename)
 *	$over_device		- The -d option (output device name)
 *	$over_flipbook		- The -k option (output to flipbook)
 *	$frame_range		- The -f option (start/end)
 *	$frame_increment	- The -i option
 *	$over_outputmode	- If the -k option is set, this will
 *				  be set to 0, otherwise it will be
 *				  set to the parameter value.
 *
 * When either the -r option is specified, then:
 *	$over_res		- Set to 1 (otherwise 0)
 *	$over_resfraction	- Set to the average of the resolution scale
 *	$over_specificres	- If $over_resfraction is "specific",
 *				  stores the actual resolution
 *
 * These overrides are applied to the CAMERA object given in the
 * initialization of SOHO.
 *
 * FILE STRUCTURE:
 *	Please see ViewportRender for details.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *	This file is used to provide overrides when the render is
 *	invoked by the render command.
